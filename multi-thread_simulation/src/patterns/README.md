# Design patterns in the simulation

This independent directory contains some design patterns in C:

1.  Facade pattern (`facade.h` and `facade.c`). This pattern is used to interface the shared memory with the viewer process.  
2.  Factory pattern (`factory.h` and `factory.c`).  
3.  State pattern (`character.h` and `character.c`).  

Factory and state patterns could be adapted and used in such a project.
